To get started, first of all clone this repo into a folder on your computer.

Once you've cloned the repo, install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install

# OR

npm install
```

You can then dive straight into coding by running:

```bash
yarn start

# OR

npm start
```

This will start up webpack and a local development server at http://localhost:3000.
